# SQL Project – Data Analysis and Database Management

A practical **SQL project** designed to strengthen skills in **database design, querying,** and **data manipulation using PostgreSQL**.
The project simulates real-world tasks of a data analyst: creating databases, building relationships, modifying schemas, and extracting insights using SQL queries.

# Tools & Technologies

**SQL** – core query language for data analysis

**PostgreSQL** – relational database used for data storage and processing

**Visual Studio Code** – SQL query execution and database management

**Git & GitHub** – version control and project collaboration

# Objectives

✅ Design and create a relational database structure
✅ Establish table relationships and constraints
✅ Perform data aggregation and transformation (GROUP BY, JOIN, COUNT, AVG)
✅ Apply complex SQL logic to extract insights and summarize data

# The Analysis

Throughout this adventure, I've turbocharged my SQL toolkit:

- **Complex Query Crafting:** Mastered the art of advanced SQL, merging tables like a pro.
- **Data Aggregation:** Got cozy with GROUP BY and turned aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG() into my data-summarizing sidekicks.
- **Analytical Wizardry:** Leveled up my real-world puzzle-solving skills, turning questions into actionable, insightful SQL queries.

# Closing Thoughts 

This project enhanced my SQL skills and provided valuable insights into the data analyst job market. The findings from the analysis serve as a guide to prioritizing skill development and job search efforts. Aspiring data analysts can better position themselves in a competitive job market by focusing on high-demand, high-salary skills. This exploration highlights the importance of continuous learning and adaptation to emerging trends in the field of data analytics.
